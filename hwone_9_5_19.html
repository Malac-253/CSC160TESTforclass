            We learned in class that computer science is the study of the process or problem-solving.<br />  
            Already, within the definition, we can see the importance of soft skills, something that the <br />  
            video touched profoundly on. The video touched on 5 points I found very important to my future <br />  
            as a computer scientist.<br />

            Point one was the idea that collaboration happens more than solo work and is more beneficial <br /> 
            to the project than I had believed. I have to keep in mind that, like larger projects, Rome <br /> 
              was not Built-in one day and also not by one person.  Collaboration is going to happen with <br /> 
              everyone, not just coders. There will be product managers, designers, and also testers that <br /> 
              I will need to be able to communicate with well. Communication will help the working process. <br /> 
              When it comes to code reviews and systematic examinations, my ability to communicate will improve <br /> 
              the feedback I can get from others. <br />

            Another point stressed in the video, and the syllabus is the importance of soft skills.  Hard work, <br /> 
              determination, communication, problem-solving, are skills needed to excel in today's working environment. <br /> 
              Merely knowing the technical syntax, however necessary, is not enough alone to work in computer science.  <br /> 
              The class will make an effort to get us ready for this by having a strict late policy to ensure <br /> 
              punctuality and diligence. <br /> 
            </p>

            The video also stressed the point that there is no "end" in a figurative sense there is always more <br />
              work to be done.  The class syllabus trains us for this by incentivizing that we do more than <br />
              what is expected. By giving an average score of 75% for doing what is expected, students will <br />
              have to do more than the average to get an above-average score in the course. Honestly, I like these <br />
              criteria, some nights I expect to be rough, but in the long run, it'll be a nice way to make sure <br />
              that I am experimenting in the class.<br />

            Empathy for the people who will interact with your end product is also another point of importance in <br />
              the video. Your code is readable, and it has enough context so that anyone can look at it and provide <br />
              feedback or help if necessary.  It is also important that your end product is made with the user niche <br />
              in mine.  For example, older people might need larger buttons, or kids might want a more colorful GUI.<br />  
              It is at this point that I would like to suggest a potential addition to the class syllabus.  A low-weighted <br />
              project outline would allow students to spend more time in the planning phase too put more thought into the <br />
              end product. This way, students will have a chance to consider the end-users better using the product.  <br />
              Especially if empathy is stressed, then this outline will allow the students to spend a bit more time <br />
              making sure that they are keeping their users and helpers in mind.<br />

              The last point in the video is that there is no typing needed to be a computer scientist which is not <br />
              crucial to the class because Centre lets any student take this class but is important to the industry  <br />
              Where there may be some "low representation" or "specific expectations".<br />
